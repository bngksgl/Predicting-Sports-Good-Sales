# Predicting-Sports-Good-Sales

As part of Data Mining-2 project, we joined Data Mining Cup (DMC 2018) as group. This yearâ€™s Data Mining Cup (DMC 2018) was about predicting the sold out date of products based on the stock at the beginning of the month and sales unit of each day. For the cup, a real world data from a sports company had been provided. The problem was a time series task based on sales unit in each day, but additional information such as color, brand, size and price of the product had also been provided. In order to evaluate the sold out units and sold out date, the sales data from October to December(3 months) was used for training and tested on the January data. For the project Python, R and RapidMiner had been used by applying Windowing, ARIMA, Regression, Ensemble and Combined models on historical sales data. In terms of a comprehensive performance evaluation, Combined Model is regarded as the best model in the prediction of sold out date.
